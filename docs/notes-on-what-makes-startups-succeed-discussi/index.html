    <p>4 VCs, a moderator, and a roomful of people. Here’s the gist.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve publicly launched Cloudvox, and anyone can use it (and buy it!), I finally get to see the outdoors again. I went to this panel on 10/14/2009 and took as many notes as I could. I missed some things, and tried not to take any comments out of context.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Who</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Andy Sack, <a href="http://www.founderscoop.com/">Founder’s Co-Op</a></li>
  <li>Mark Ashida, <a href="http://www.ovp.com/">OVP Venture Partners</a></li>
  <li>Mike Mathieu, <a href="http://www.frontseat.org/">Front Seat</a></li>
  <li>Pete Higgins, <a href="http://www.secondave.com/">Second Avenue Partners</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Moderated by Dave McShea of <a href="http://perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a> in Seattle. Notes are chronological over 1 hour. Bold is mine.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>How do you evaluate a company as an investor?</strong></p>

<p>Sack: “Accelerating on the downhill” (recession) as much more more important than speeding uphill</p>

<p>Higgins: With right customers, recession means prospects are reevaluating costs, chance to stand out. Cheaper inputs (staff).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What mistakes do you see often?</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Business plans hard to understand. Entrepreneur unwilling to <strong>synthesize down to the real bet they’re making</strong> – might mean they don’t know it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“We don’t have any” competition. <strong>Generally that’s “meeting over.”</strong> Too narrow def of competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under-rating domain expertise when they have it/have been the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not realizing VCs treat a meeting like an interview or date. Can you work with together deeply? Listen!** Don’t pitch/sell.** Testing reactions, pushing buttons.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mathieu:</p>

<p>Describe investment as series of risks - then <strong>help investors calculate market price for your risks.</strong></p>

<p>Not getting 2nd meeting probably means risk higher than you think.</p>

<p>80% * 80% * 80% (series of risks) is worse odds than a coin flip. How can you extract the risks?</p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>Team reduces risk - have these people worked together? Experience is risk mitigation</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What constitutes differentiation?</strong></p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>“In the eye of the beholder.”</p>

<p>At Housevalues there wasn’t a patentable one.</p>

<p>Likes technical barriers. Stuff that’s hard to do. Doesn’t have to be patentable.</p>

<p>Marketing barrier “not as confident that it’s sustainable especially on a national basis.”</p>

<p>Barriers are truly lower with SaaS: <strong>domain/customer expertise must be strong differentiator</strong> “because it’s just software”</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>At Amazon, Bezos ranked 25 things to sell before choosing books. How do you sell?</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>Book market incredibly fragmented, easy purchase.</p>

<p>Contrast with selling infrastructure to mobile where 5 guys decide your success. Consider: Do customers tend to buy new stuff?</p>

<p>Who are adjacent players? Often best to find industry with lots of established players who just haven’t picked up on changes. Like unmanned airplanes (Insitu).</p>

<p>Had tailwinds: Gov’t wanted it, incumbents culturally unable to do small cheap product. <strong>But run when big player decides it’s strategic. Elephants will step on you.</strong></p>

<p>Mathieu:</p>

<p>With BetterBills, Seattle City Light finance group loved new bill format, but 6 months of customer delay.</p>

<p>Competitor emerged who realized that <strong>motivated customer was conservation group, not accounting.</strong></p>

<p>Ask who’s truly motivated to buy</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Cash is king. How do you evaluate capital requirements and manage cash?</strong></p>

<p>Mathieu:</p>

<p>Cash matters first, then changes to cashflow (<strong>they merge</strong>).</p>

<p>You hear all this advice: banks will only give you money when you need it, raise more than you need.</p>

<p>All Star started with $200k. Got profitable in 3 months, went into 2nd market.</p>

<p>From cashflow positive to losing $50k/mo. Wife caught on.</p>

<p>2 changes fixed: 1) marketing must break even on performance 2) tie customer price to your performance.</p>

<p>Cashflow doesn’t go away 5 years in, profitable, new controller made many millions worth of payments on same day. Balance -$200k.</p>

<p><strong>Use prepay and annual subscriptions. Biggest customer prepaid quarterly</strong> and cut need for outside capital</p>

<p>Sack:</p>

<p>Yeah cash management matters, but so does time: wasting a year of founding team!</p>

<p><strong>No bank balance to measure this. Certain period to see evidence that dream can be reality (~3 years).</strong></p>

<p>“Like cash, time is a resource that goes away”</p>

<p>One company: had epiphany 8 months in, changed directions, 18 months in.</p>

<p>Not exactly where they wanted to be. Should we change again?</p>

<p>No!  <strong>Won’t have made any progress before losing confidence.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What VC trends do you see?</strong></p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>Critical how you get money. VCs running out of money - so much budgeted for existing investments.</p>

<p>A year behind and all need 1 more round. Not all portfolio cos are covered.</p>

<p><strong>Non-participating VCs will get crushed. Reduced to common, 10:1 reverse not uncommon</strong></p>

<p>Also 1 person stuck writing $5mm check is way higher bar than 3 sharing.</p>

<p>Finding new outside VC is hard when tainted by non-participating existing VC</p>

<p>I’m probably going to be here long after you’re gone (longer than founders).</p>

<p>No escape for us: 7-8 years</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What habits should entrepreneurs use or avoid?</strong></p>

<p>Sack:</p>

<p>Recurring rituals. Write out and book on calendar.</p>

<p>Daily: blog, tweet, the 1 thing that must get done today.</p>

<p>Weekly: Sun night look at week ahead and pick 1 priority for week.</p>

<p>Quarterly: take time off. Have a weekend.</p>

<p>Mathieu:</p>

<p>Know yourself.</p>

<p><strong>What types of stuff do you just have to grind through?  Know what’s missing in you and patch holes</strong></p>

<p>Had demo of alpha-stage niche site. Missing: had no idea of was whether anyone would pay - a must fix.</p>

<p>Told entrepreneur <strong>“When you leave you’re going to go home and say ‘I should talk with customers to see whether they’ll pay, but first I have to fix this bug and add these features…’“</strong>.</p>

<p>Not bad thing as long as you know and fill.</p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>After 3 people, entrepreneurs under-manage.</p>

<p>Board emails: at least 1 a week.</p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>1 page “plan of record” so when staff overhears stuff, have reference that plan is not changing. A little formal.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What’s the 1 big mistake that comes to mind?</strong></p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p><strong>“I’m good at this” when it’s clear you’re not.</strong></p>

<p>Either mis-representing, or poor self-awareness.</p>

<p>Also not asking what customers actually think. Too much trust where a technology appears to fit w/o asking</p>

<p>Sack:</p>

<p><strong>It’s not a pitch, it’s a conversation.</strong></p>

<p>Engage. What is investor truly interested in? Ask them stuff!</p>

<p>If I leave without having talked, I’m not engaged.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Revenue forecasts are a shot in the dark. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>Agree. <strong>Somebody told entrepreneurs that 3rd year should be profitable.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost to learn/get to the point where you have some confidence?</strong></p>

<p>Sack:</p>

<p>Forecast is to get comfortable playing with model and levers.</p>

<p><strong>See/tweak unit economics.</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>Most businesses have an analog.</p>

<p>Sniff test, ie if you’re a distribution company and are 10x more profitable than other distributors.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What are VCs looking for an in exit strategy?</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>Least successful slide - phrase “IPO or M&amp;A” useless.</p>

<p>Generally look elsewhere when VCs gets particular about exit strategy.</p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>Might disagree a bit. Security industry has many exits but small - $10-20mm, bought out in year 2.</p>

<p>Should inform your raise, plans. We look at P/E and P/S. Ethanol P/S &lt;1, learn from it.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What’s the weakest point of a recent deal you actually did? How did you address it?</strong></p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>2 guys from Microsoft. Missing marketing. That was big risk - need to find someone who works well with them.</p>

<p><strong>Solved with a (one!) person.</strong></p>

<p>Higgins:</p>

<p>Not sure it’s working yet, but: invested in “3 guys and dog at UW.”</p>

<p>Research risk. New ideas every day but maybe not towards product.</p>

<p>“Boring engineering management” stuff - runs an eng mtg every week. Dates, task list.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Really early seed-stage capital seems broken. What’s the new model?</strong></p>

<p>Ashida:</p>

<p>Disagree that there’s not seed money for good ideas. I’m willing.</p>

<p>Symform was 2 guys. Met 7 months before.</p>

<p>More peer review from ideas in Silicon Valley: <strong>95% of bad ideas there get killed by peers.</strong></p>

<p>Sack:</p>

<p>Seed has gotten harder compared to 18 months ago.</p>

<p><strong>“Deal that doesn’t get done” is often the best deal</strong>: No (or much less) VC relaxes the pressure on revenue.</p>
